These plans identify and map multi-species corridors that will best maintain wildlife movement between wildland blocks, as well as highlight specific planning and road mitigation measures required to maintain connectivity in these corridors. 

THe analysis team of conservation biologists and GIS Analysts at Northern Arizona University, and included Paul Beier, Dan Majka, Emily Garding, and Jeff Jenness.
